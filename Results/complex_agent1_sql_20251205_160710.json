Identify the column we need from the table: The opponent's name needs to be retrieved.\n2. Find the corresponding value from the table that matches our criteria: The date needs to match 'November 1'.\n3. Construct the SQL SELECT statement with the appropriate column name and WHERE clause to filter the records by the specified date.\n\nTherefore, the generated SQL query is:\nSQL Query: [SELECT Opponent FROM game_records WHERE Date = 'November 1'] This query will select the 'Opponent' from the 'game_records' table where the 'Date' is 'November 1', which directly answers the question \"Who is the opponent on November 1?\". The exact single quotation marks (' ') around 'November 1' are required to ensure the date is treated as a string literal. The number 1 in the sample row is ignored since it is the ID column.",
