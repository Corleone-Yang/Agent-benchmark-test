Start with the first number given in the problem: 15.\n2. Add the second number to the first: 15 + 27.\n3. To add these numbers, align them by place value (ones and tens):\n   ```\n    15\n+  27\n    ---\n   ```\n4. Begin adding from the rightmost digit (ones place):\n   - 5 + 7 = 12\n   - Write down 2 in the ones place of the sum\n   - Carry over the 1 to the tens place\n5. Now add the digits in the tens place along with the carried over digit:\n   - 1 (carried over) + 1 + 2 = 4\n   - Write down 4 in the tens place of the sum\n6. The complete addition is:\n   ```\n    15\n+  27\n    ---\n     42\n   ```\n\nTherefore, the answer is 42.",

Understand that \"7 times 9\" means adding the number 9 to itself 7 times.\n2. You can break it down into simpler calculations:\n   - First multiplication: \\( 7 \\times 1 = 7 \\)\n   - Second multiplication: \\( 7 \\times 2 = 14 \\)\n   - Third multiplication: \\( 7 \\times 3 = 21 \\)\n   - Fourth multiplication: \\( 7 \\times 4 = 28 \\)\n   - Fifth multiplication: \\( 7 \\times 5 = 35 \\)\n   - Sixth multiplication: \\( 7 \\times 6 = 42 \\)\n   - Seventh multiplication: \\( 7 \\times 7 = 49 \\)\n   - Eighth multiplication: \\( 7 \\times 8 = 56 \\)\n   - Ninth multiplication: \\( 7 \\times 9 = 63 \\)\n\nAlternatively, you can use a faster calculation method by recognizing that:\n\\[ 7 \\times 9 = 7 \\times (10 - 1) = (7 \\times 10) - (7 \\times 1) = 70 - 7 = 63 \\]\n\nSo, 7 times 9 equals 63.
