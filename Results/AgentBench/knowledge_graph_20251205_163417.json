CMOS sensors are commonly used in high-performance cameras due to their efficiency and ability to handle higher ISO values like 5000 without significant loss in image quality. \n\nNote: Some top-end cameras may use a different type of sensor, such as CCD (Charge-Coupled Device), but CMOS is more prevalent for high-ISO performance in modern digital cameras. To be precise, it would depend on the specific model of the camera.",

Common symptoms include lethargy, weight loss, fluid accumulation in the abdomen or chest, and yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice). On the other hand, diseases commonly associated with aging in humans can vary widely but often include chronic conditions such as arthritis, cognitive decline (dementia), osteoporosis, cardiovascular issues, diabetes, and respiratory problems. Symptoms for these diseases can be extensive, including joint pain, memory loss, bone density loss, high blood pressure, insulin resistance, breathing difficulties, and frequent infections. The exact symptoms depend on the specific age-related condition and individual health status. To know more about FIP and human age-related diseases, consulting with a veterinarian or healthcare professional is recommended.",

FIP has specific characteristics related to its causative Coronavirus, which manifests in two forms: Wet (effusive) and Dry (exudative). Wet FIP involves fluid accumulation in body cavities, while Dry FIP affects internal organs leading to tissue damage. Old diseases, on the other hand, include various conditions that have existed for centuries but have been studied less rigorously due to their historical nature. They can range from plagues to common illnesses like measles or smallpox.\n\nTo summarize:\n- **Feline Infectious Peritonitis:** Caused by a coronavirus, it presents as Wet (fluid accumulation) or Dry (tissue damage).\n- **Old Diseases:** Historically prevalent illnesses from past eras, often with limited modern medical understanding. Examples vary widely, including historical plagues and current known pathogens.",

His contributions were more aligned with fields such as astronomy, mathematics, physics, and the Islamic Golden Age's intellectual pursuits. Universities during his time did not have specialized departments in the modern sense, so he likely engaged in various scholarly activities that contributed to the broader academic community of the time. To provide a precise answer, one would need to refer to historical accounts of his work and the institutions he interacted with, but no specific university department can be definitively assigned to him.",

Specifically, they were both used for space exploration missions, carrying astronauts and scientific equipment to the Moon during NASA's Apollo program. Both rockets had a strong emphasis on delivering large payloads efficiently, which was crucial for achieving the ambitious goals of the Apollo lunar landings. While the Saturn V was NASA's primary launch vehicle for the Apollo program, the LR-101 was a proposed U.S. Air Force satellite launch vehicle, demonstrating that these capabilities were seen as valuable across different branches of the U.S. military and aerospace industry. However, due to budget cuts, the LR-101 never entered service. To summarize, both rockets supported the function of launching heavy payloads into space. Answering in a concise manner.

The cyclones in the same category (Category 4) that have affected eastern North America include:\n\n1. Hurricane Donna (1960)\n2. Hurricane Carol (1954)\n3. Hurricane Hazel (1954)\n\nThese hurricanes made landfall along the East Coast of the United States, bringing heavy rainfall and severe flooding to areas like New England and the Mid-Atlantic states. Answering this question requires identifying cyclones within the same category and verifying their impact on eastern North America. It's essential to note that while Marie had the potential to do so, its path was different and it did not directly impact eastern North America. Answer concise. To answer concisely:\n\nHurricane Donna (1960), Hurricane Carol (1954), and Hurricane Hazel (1954) were all Category 4 hurricanes that affected eastern North America.
