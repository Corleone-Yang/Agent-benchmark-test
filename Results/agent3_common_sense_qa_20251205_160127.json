Respond with just the letter (A, B, C, or D) and a brief explanation.\n\nAnswer: A) It melts\n\nExplanation: In the real world, ice turns into water when it is warmed up because water has a lower freezing point than ice. This process is called melting.",

Respond with just the letter (A, B, C, or D) and a brief explanation.\n\nAnswer: B) Sunlight and water\n\nExplanation: Plants require sunlight for photosynthesis to produce energy and water to hydrate their cells and transport nutrients throughout the plant. Options A (Darkness and cold) are detrimental to plant growth, option C (Only air) is insufficient as plants need more than just air, and option D (Only soil) overlooks the importance of other essential elements. Therefore, the correct choice is B.",

Respond with just the letter (A, B, C, or D) and a brief explanation.\n\nAnswer: B) Feeling tired\n\nExplanation: Not sleeping for a long time leads to fatigue and tiredness due to the body's inability to properly rest and recover during sleep. The other options are either unrealistic (becoming invisible) or counterintuitive (feeling energized after not sleeping). Option C, growing taller, is also unrelated to lack of sleep. Therefore, the logical choice is feeling tired.",
